## Features
### Description Timestamps
Timestamps seen in Youtube Videos are taken from the video description. If 
timestamps are present in the video description, HoppyTime will also make a playlist 
from that information.

</p>

### Comment Timestamps
Frequently, timestamps are not present in the video description and a helpful
viewer comments the relevant timestamps instead. If timestamps are not present 
in the video description, HoppyTime will search through the top 20 comments 
instead.

### History
A log of previously watched videos will appear in the [History Tab](https://hoppytime.io/history). 
HoppyTime uses the localStorage within the Web Storage API to keep track of this 
information.

## Inspiration
Season 4 part 1 of Attack on Titan was airing at the time, and I kept listening 
to this same [lofi playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su8jZm-CWZI) over 
and over. It got me through several midterms and final exams. I enjoyed the 
playlist but the repetition began to lower my appreciation for the music. 
The idea for HoppyTime came from this desire to mix things up and continue to 
enjoy a beloved experience.
